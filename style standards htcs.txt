I (Riyan) worked on this with Olivia and Kyara (and Dylan also showed up)

Format code using Option + Shift + F (Mac) or Alt + Shift + F (Not Mac)

Comments for what a line of code does should be above the line of code

Add a comment for what each method does before the method using /* */ notation

Keep testers reasonably simple and commented

Segment different parts of each method with a newline in between them

Tabs or 4 spaces for indentations when necessary

Make a new class for the tester

Use spaces between comments (Ex: // comment)

Keep brackets in this style:
if (condition) {
    //code
} else {
    //code
}

Don't write methods that throw exceptions (use try/catch)

No using fancy notation that nobody knows
Example:
variable = (condition) ? expressionTrue : expressionFalse;
